### Hotel Reservation Prediction using R

Online hotel booking platforms have made it more convenient for customers to cancel their reservations without incurring significant fees or penalties. However, this flexibility can result in potential revenue losses for hotels. In this project, we aim to leverage data mining techniques to analyze hotel reservation data and develop predictive models that can assist hotel owners in better anticipating whether a customer is likely to confirm or cancel their reservation. The dataset utilized in this project encompasses approximately 18,000 hotel reservation records. The "hotel_reservation.csv" file contains the reservation data, where each row represents a single reservation record. The accompanying "Variables description.txt" file provides a detailed explanation of the columns present in the dataset.

By applying data mining and machine learning algorithms to this dataset, we seek to uncover patterns, trends, and key factors that influence a customer's decision to honor or cancel their hotel reservation. Throughout this project, we will explore various data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering methods, and predictive modeling approaches to build accurate and reliable models for hotel reservation cancellation prediction. The ultimate goal is to provide hotel owners with actionable intelligence and tools to proactively manage their reservation systems.
